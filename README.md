# MemeMe1.0/MemeMe2.0
2nd (and 3rd) project for Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree. This app allows the user to take or choose a picture, then add a bottom and top caption to the picture, and consequently, save the picture to their library.

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/cmorierroy/MemeMe1.0`

## Usage
Run this on the XCode Simulator or on your device(through XCode).
To get a feel for which ViewController to look at first, take a look at "Main.storyboard".

## Bug Warning
There are a few bugs that pop up here and there.<br> I will get to documenting them fully and fixing them once I finish the Udacity nanodegree. <br>
-As of now, pictures can have a lot of grey background surrounding them, which is annoying.

## Extra features to be added
-The ability to resize,place, and color the text.
